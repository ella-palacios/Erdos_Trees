## Forest Fire and Bio-Diversity Project Notes:
### The purpose of this living document is to have a place to put all thoughts and outside research from each group member in one place. 

#### Previous Cohort Wildfire Project
Their project surrounds the data involved in what weather patterns cause forest fires and given a specific weather pattern can we predict if a fire could/will ignite. They used the natural factors such as rainfall, relative humidity, and temperature as primary indicators of if a fire will or will not ignite.
